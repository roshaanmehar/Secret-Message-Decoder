# Secret-Message-Decoder
This repository contains a fun piece of code that reads a list of (x, character, y) values and reconstructs a visual grid of those characters, effectively revealing a hidden or “secret” message. It was created as a puzzle-solving exercise and can be extended for various coordinate-based code-breaking problems.
